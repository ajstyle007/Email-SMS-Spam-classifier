# Email-SMS-Spam-classifier 📧📱
In today's digital age, communication via email and SMS is essential, but it also opens the door to unwanted and potentially harmful spam messages. This project focuses on developing a robust Email/SMS Spam Classifier that leverages machine learning techniques to accurately distinguish between spam (unwanted) and ham (legitimate) messages.

Live Demo 🌐 : https://musk12-email-spam-classifier.hf.space

This link takes you to a user-friendly web interface where you can input your own email or SMS text to see if it's classified as spam or not. The interface includes several useful features:

✍️ Input Box: Enter your text to be classified.
🧹 Clear Text Button: Quickly clear the input box with a single click.
🔍 Predict Button: Click to get the spam/ham prediction instantly.
📝 Character Counter: Displays the length of the text you've entered in real-time, helping you keep track of the message size.
How to Use:

Visit the live demo link.
Enter a sample email or SMS text in the input box.
The character counter will update as you type, showing the number of characters.
Click the Predict button to see the classification result—either "Spam" or "Ham."
Use the Clear Text button to reset the input box and try another text.
Note: The live link provides a quick and easy way to interact with the model without needing to run the code locally.
