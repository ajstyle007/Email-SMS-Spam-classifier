# Email-SMS-Spam-classifier 📧📱
In today's digital age, communication via email and SMS is essential, but it also opens the door to unwanted and potentially harmful spam messages. This project focuses on developing a robust Email/SMS Spam Classifier that leverages machine learning techniques to accurately distinguish between spam (unwanted) and ham (legitimate) messages.
